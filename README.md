# ML_final_project
 Created by Michael Dunlap, Cole Whittington, Lucas Rayder, Isaac Tabor, and Seth Spire


The Data for this project is located [Here](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/ornl-cloud-arctictreeline-dendrometry-env-2185-1)
Note that the data takes up 3 GBs, so it is challenging to run

The Finalized Data is called categorical_data.csv and is located in the Final App folder

The Data Engineering Code is called Data_Engineering.R and adding_cats.ipynb, both are located on the main Repo

The Final Published App is located [Here](https://019b094e-e373-2112-8a5e-ea2253e57131.share.connect.posit.cloud/)

The code for this app is located in the Final App Folder


The Order of Work to Follow our process would be
Data Engineering.R > Adding Cats.ipynb > Our own folders/work (like michael_log_regression) > Final_App > Published on Posit Cloud
